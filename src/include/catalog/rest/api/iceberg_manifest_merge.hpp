//! manifests sharing both are candidates to merge. Bins selected for merge have their entries read
//! and rewritten into a single new manifest; everything else is passed through unchanged. Returns
//! the resulting manifest-list entries.
//!
//! Sequence-number rules: entries pulled from already-committed manifests keep
//! their original (historical) sequence numbers and are written EXISTING; entries that are new in
//! this transaction keep status ADDED with inherited (NULL) sequence numbers and are never demoted.
//! `snapshot_id` is the id of the snapshot being created; it is used to decide which DELETED entries
//! to retain (only deletes made by this snapshot) -- mirroring Java's ManifestMergeManager.
